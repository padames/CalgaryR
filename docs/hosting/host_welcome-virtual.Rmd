## R Consortium Code of Conduct

A member of the R Community is:

* Open: Collaboration, receptive to constructive comment and criticism, accepting of anyone who wishes to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where all can participate and everyone can make a difference.

* Considerate: We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of our peers, as the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

* Respectful: We're respectful of others, including positions, skills, commitments, efforts, and processes. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the R community. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
