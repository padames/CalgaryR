<!-- Student Presentation from DataSci Program -->

* September 5, 2019 - **nonlinear models with R**, by chel <br>[RSVP at meetup](https://www.meetup.com/calgaryr/events/263815910/){target="_blank"}<br>A nonlinear model is an important tool used to describe the complex nature of observations which are not adequately explained by a linear model in medical and bioengineering research.  The first session (40 mins) provides an introduction to the use of nonlinear models with R.  The following are considered:  1. choosing good candidate nonlinear models, 2. estimating parameters (and choice of starting values), 3. checking model assumptions, and 4. summarizing results from the model.  In the second session (30 mins), key R functions are introduced and outputs are visualized step-by-step using `nlme` package.  Extension to data with repeated measurements will be discussed if time permits.

* October 3, 2019 - **Landscape of feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning** by [Dr. Alastair Muir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairkerrmuir?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BTa6CM%2BqmQCqnJqVigDffeQ%3D%3D){target="_blank"}  <br> <br> Please [RSVP at meetup](https://www.meetup.com/calgaryr/events/264815846/){target="_blank"} if you are interested.  <br><br>The meeting starts by Dr. Catherine Eastwood and Dr. Muir will give a talk. Machine Learning techniques, while powerful, are very non-linear.  Configuring the problem, choosing an appropriate algorithm and reaching an optimal solution makes this a complex task.  Using an example of the calculation of NMR coupling constants, he will discuss the landscape of feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, and maybe a bit about explainable models. You may bring your own laptop to run the code in the session.  R and Rstudio should be installed. This talk is running approximately 90 minutes.

* November 7, 2019 - **Functional Programming Techniques in R** by [Dr. Matthias Kanta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-kanta-8a0923?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BmZI1%2FQ%2BNRyKhAWzuIWWhuA%3D%3D){target="_blank"} <br><br>Please RSVP at [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/calgaryr/events/265648330/)<br><br> This presentation will begin with a short introduction into functional programming concepts, how they differ from imperial programming and why they are important. This will be followed by a discussion of language features in R that facilitate the use of functional techniques as well as some deficiencies. Examples will be given and seasoned R users may realize that they have
used some of these techniques all the time. Finally, functional alternatives to using R will be mentioned. <br> <br>
